## 🚀 How to Showcase Your Project

### **For Live Demos:**

#### **Option 1: One-Click Demo (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\Nilabha\OneDrive\Desktop\SIH25026\SIH25026_Dual_"

# Run the one-click demo launcher
.\demo\start-demo.ps1
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Launch**
```bash
# Start the terminology service
cd Backend
node launch-terminology.js

# In another terminal, run the interactive demo
cd demo  
node sih-demo.js
```

### **For Judge Presentations:**

#### **1. Start Service** (30 seconds before presenting)
```bash
cd Backend
node launch-terminology.js
```
Service will be available at: http://localhost:3001

#### **2. Demo URLs Ready** (bookmark these)

## 🎯 Presentation Strategy

### **5-Minute Presentation Flow:**

1. **Problem (45s):** "AYUSH medical systems lack standardized digital terminology"
2. **Solution (60s):** "We built NAMASTE - first FHIR-compliant AYUSH-ICD11 bridge"  
3. **Live Demo (2.5min):** Show FHIR resources, dual-coding, API operations
4. **Impact (45s):** "150 concepts standardized, production-ready architecture"
5. **Q&A (30s):** "Ready for technical questions about FHIR or architecture"

### **Demo Script (Phase 2 Enhanced):**
```
"Watch this Phase 2 enhancement - WHO API integration in action..."
→ Show: http://localhost:3001/who/entities/search?q=diabetes

"Our system now connects directly to WHO's official ICD-11 API..."
→ Show: http://localhost:3001/who/entities/410525008

"While maintaining our NAMASTE-ICD11 dual coding system..."  
→ Show: http://localhost:3001/namaste/NAM001/mappings

"With enhanced confidence scoring and semantic validation."
→ Show the enhanced JSON response with WHO data integration
```

## 🔥 Judge Q&A Preparation

### **Technical Questions:**

**Q: "How do you ensure FHIR R4 compliance?"**  
**A:** "We implement official FHIR resource structures with proper meta profiles, standard operations like $lookup and $translate, and complete metadata including publisher and jurisdiction information."

**Q: "What makes this production ready?"**  
**A:** "RESTful microservice architecture, comprehensive error handling with FHIR OperationOutcome, health monitoring endpoints, in-memory caching for performance, and bulk operations for scalability."

**Q: "How does semantic mapping work?"**  
**A:** "We use confidence scores from 0.47 to 0.77 based on semantic similarity, map to both ICD-11 MMS and TM2 modules, and provide FHIR equivalence levels for each mapping relationship."
